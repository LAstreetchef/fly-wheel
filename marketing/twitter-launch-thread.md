# Twitter/X Launch Thread for Blog Squad

## Thread 1: The Launch Announcement

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I spent $8,000 on content agencies last year.

The result? 6 blog posts. 2 months of back-and-forth.

So we built something better. 🧵

---

**Tweet 2:**
The problem with content:

• Content mills = garbage
• Freelancers = inconsistent  
• Agencies = expensive + slow
• In-house = $60k+/year

There had to be a middle ground.

---

**Tweet 3:**
Enter: AI-powered content squads.

Not ChatGPT copy-paste.

A system where specialized AI agents handle:
→ Competitive research
→ SEO keyword strategy  
→ Content writing

Then humans review for quality.

---

**Tweet 4:**
The result:

✓ Agency-quality research
✓ Freelancer prices ($250-300/post)
✓ 24-48 hour turnaround

No more 3-week waits.
No more "managing writers."

---

**Tweet 5:**
We're calling it Blog Squad.

4 packages:
🥉 Starter: $300/post
🥈 Growth: $1k/mo (4 posts)
🥇 Scale: $2k/mo (8 posts)
🏆 Enterprise: Custom

Each post includes research, SEO, and revisions.

---

**Tweet 6:**
Not sure? Try a single post for $150.

Fully researched. SEO optimized. 48 hours.

If you don't love it, don't come back.
If you do, the $150 credits toward a monthly plan.

Would love feedback from the content marketing crowd.

What's broken about how you get blog content today?

## Thread 2: The "Problem" Thread

**Tweet 1:**
Hot take: Most businesses don't have a content problem.

They have a content *production* problem.

Thread on why content marketing fails (and how to fix it) 🧵

---

**Tweet 2:**
You know content works.

HubSpot, Ahrefs, Zapier — they all built empires on blogs.

So you try to do the same.

---

**Tweet 3:**
Step 1: Hire a freelancer

"Can you write 4 posts a month?"

They say yes. Deliver 2. Ghost by month 3.

Back to square one.

---

**Tweet 4:**
Step 2: Try an agency

$5,000/month minimum.
8 posts promised.
6 delivered.
2 need major rewrites.

And you're doing half the research yourself anyway.

---

**Tweet 5:**
Step 3: Give up

"We'll just do it in-house."

Which means: the founder writes one post at 11pm, then nothing for 6 months.

Sound familiar?

---

**Tweet 6:**
The real problem isn't writing.

It's the *system*:
- Finding writers
- Briefing them
- Managing revisions
- Doing SEO research
- Maintaining consistency

That's 10+ hours/month. Minimum.

---

**Tweet 7:**
The solution isn't "better writers."

It's removing yourself from the process entirely.

A system that takes a topic and delivers a publish-ready post. Research included.

---

**Tweet 8:**
That's what we built at Blog Squad.

AI agents do the research and first draft.
Humans ensure quality.
You just approve and publish.

$250/post. 48 hours.

## Individual Viral-Style Tweets

**Tweet A:**
$300/post for agency-quality content sounds expensive until you realize:

- Agencies charge $800-1500
- Your time briefing freelancers = $100+
- Your time reviewing bad drafts = $200+

The cheapest option is rarely the best value.

---

**Tweet B:**
The best content marketing advice I ever got:

"Stop trying to write content. Start building a content system."

Writers come and go.
Systems scale.

---

**Tweet C:**
Real cost of a $75 blog post:

$75 - writer fee
$50 - your time reviewing/editing
$100 - your time doing SEO research
$75 - revision back-and-forth

Actual cost: $300

Might as well pay $300 for one that's done right.

---

**Tweet D:**
Content marketing tip:

Stop competing on "more content."

Start competing on "better content, faster."

One great post > five mediocre ones.

---

**Tweet E:**
If your content strategy is "publish and pray" — it's not a strategy.

Every post should target:
- Specific keyword
- Clear search intent
- Defined audience pain point

Otherwise you're just blogging for fun.
