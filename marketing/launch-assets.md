## 🚀 Product Hunt Launch Post

### Title
**Blog Squad — AI content with agency quality, not agency prices**

### Tagline
Research-backed blog posts in 24-48 hours. The middle ground between content mills and $5k/month retainers.

### Description

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I built Blog Squad after watching too many small businesses get stuck in the same trap:

**Option A:** Pay $25-75 for content mill garbage that sounds like it was written by someone who's never seen your industry.

**Option B:** Pay $3,000-5,000/month to an agency for 4 mediocre posts and a lot of "strategy calls."

**Option C:** Hire a freelancer and spend more time managing them than it would take to write the posts yourself.

None of these work.

**Blog Squad is the middle ground.** We use specialized AI agents for research, SEO analysis, and writing — supervised by humans who actually understand content strategy. The result:

- 📝 Agency-quality posts with real research and original insights
- 🔍 Full SEO strategy included (keyword research, competitor analysis, optimization)
- ⚡ 24-48 hour turnaround, not 2-week wait times
- 🎯 Brand voice matching that sounds like you, not a robot
- 💰 Starting at $300/post or $1,000/month for 4 posts

**Who it's for:**
- Startups who know they need content but can't justify agency budgets
- Small businesses tired of generic content that doesn't rank
- Marketing teams stretched thin who need quality posts without management overhead

We're launching with a $150 trial post so you can see the quality before committing. No pitch decks. No discovery calls. Just good content, delivered fast.

Would love your feedback — especially if you've struggled with content before. What worked? What didn't?

## 📰 Hacker News "Show HN" Post

### Title
**Show HN: Blog Squad – AI-powered blog content service ($300/post vs $3k+ agencies)**

### Post Body

I've been building content systems for a while, and I kept running into the same problem: there's no good middle option for blog content.

Content mills are cheap but the output is garbage. Agencies are expensive and slow. Freelancers require babysitting. AI tools give you rough drafts that need heavy editing.

So I built Blog Squad. It's a content service (not a tool) that uses specialized AI agents — one for research, one for SEO analysis, one for writing — supervised by humans. We handle the whole pipeline: topic research, keyword strategy, competitor analysis, writing, and optimization.

The result is agency-quality posts delivered in 24-48 hours at $300/post (or $1,000/month for 4 posts).

**How it works technically:**

1. Research agent crawls competitor content, finds gaps, and identifies angles that aren't overdone
2. SEO agent pulls keyword data, analyzes SERP intent, and builds the optimization strategy
3. Writing agent produces the draft with the research and SEO requirements baked in
4. Human review for brand voice, accuracy, and that "doesn't feel like AI" polish

The key insight: AI is good at the tedious parts (research synthesis, keyword mapping, first drafts) but humans are still needed for the judgment calls (what angle is actually interesting, does this match the brand, is this argument actually sound).

We're not trying to replace writers. We're trying to make the whole content production process faster and more accessible for businesses that can't afford $5k/month agency retainers.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture, pricing model, or why I think this approach beats pure AI writing tools.

### r/entrepreneur

**Title:** Launched my first productized service after 6 months of "building in public" (lessons learned)

**Body:**

Been lurking here for years. Finally have something to share.

**What I built:** Blog Squad — a content service that uses AI agents for research/SEO/writing, with human oversight. Basically trying to deliver agency-quality blog posts at $300/post instead of the $800-1,500 agencies charge.

**Why I built it:** I was doing content strategy consulting and kept seeing the same pattern. Clients either:
- Wasted money on cheap content that hurt their SEO
- Couldn't afford real agencies
- Tried AI tools but the output needed so much editing it wasn't worth it

Seemed like a gap in the market.

**What I learned:**

1. **Productize before you're ready.** I spent way too long perfecting the AI pipeline. Should have launched 3 months earlier with a more manual process.

2. **Pricing is harder than the product.** Went back and forth between per-post and subscription. Landed on both — gives people flexibility.

3. **Nobody cares about your tech stack.** I thought the AI angle would be the selling point. Turns out people just want quality content fast. The "how" doesn't matter.

4. **Start with a trial offer.** $150 trial post removes all risk. Way easier to get that first yes.

Revenue goal is $5k MRR by end of Q1. Currently at $0 because I literally just launched lol.

Link in bio if anyone wants to check it out. Happy to answer questions about productized services or AI content pipelines.

### r/smallbusiness

**Title:** What are you all doing for blog content? (and my solution after trying everything)

**Body:**

Genuine question because I struggled with this for years before building my own solution.

The options always felt bad:
- **DIY**: Takes forever, I'm not a writer
- **Content mills**: Cheap but the quality tanks your credibility
- **Freelancers**: Good ones are expensive, bad ones waste your time
- **Agencies**: $3-5k/month minimum, often for mediocre work

I ended up building a service (Blog Squad) that uses AI for the heavy lifting (research, SEO analysis, first drafts) but has humans polish it so it doesn't read like ChatGPT wrote it.

We charge $300/post or $1k/month for 4 posts. Turnaround is 24-48 hours.

**But I'm genuinely curious what others do:**
- Do you write your own content?
- Have you found agencies that are actually worth it?
- Given up on blogs entirely?

Content marketing works (I've seen it firsthand) but the execution is such a pain point for small businesses.

### r/marketing

**Title:** The "middle market" for content services is completely broken (and why I'm trying to fix it)

**Body:**

Hot take: the content services market has a massive gap.

**Bottom tier ($25-100/post):** Content mills, offshore writers, pure AI slop. You get what you pay for.

**Top tier ($3,000-10,000/month):** Agencies with strategists, account managers, and fancy decks. Good if you have the budget.

**Middle tier:** ...basically nothing?

If you're a startup or small business that:
- Needs quality content that actually ranks
- Can't justify $5k/month
- Doesn't have time to manage freelancers

Your options are slim.

I built Blog Squad to fill this gap. $300/post, agency-quality output, 24-48 hour turnaround. We use AI for research and first drafts but humans for strategy and polish.

**The controversial part:** I think AI lets us deliver agency-quality work at 1/3 the price because we've automated the tedious parts (research synthesis, keyword mapping, outline creation) while keeping humans on the judgment calls.

Curious what this sub thinks. Is the middle market actually underserved? Or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

### r/SEO

**Title:** Building an SEO-first content service — what I learned about what actually matters for ranking

**Body:**

Been building Blog Squad (AI-assisted content service with human oversight) and wanted to share some SEO insights from producing dozens of posts.

**What actually moves the needle:**

1. **Search intent matching > keyword density.** Google's gotten scary good at understanding intent. We spend more time analyzing SERP intent than anything else.

2. **Original research/angles matter.** Regurgitating what's already ranking doesn't work anymore. Every post needs at least one original insight or angle.

3. **Topical authority compounds.** One post does nothing. 8+ posts in a topic cluster is where things start to click.

4. **Internal linking is still underrated.** New post? Link it from 5 related posts. Simple but most people don't do it.

**What doesn't matter as much as people think:**

- Exact keyword in H1 (semantic matching handles this)
- Post length beyond "adequate" (1,500 words is fine, 3,000 rarely helps)
- Publishing frequency (quality > quantity, always)

Our service (https://lastreetchef.github.io/blog-squad/) is built around these principles. Full SEO strategy included with every post — keyword research, competitor analysis, optimization — at $300/post.

What's working for you all lately? SEO feels like it's changed a lot in the last 12 months.

### r/startups

**Title:** Soft-launched my AI content service yesterday. Here's my pricing strategy and why I'm nervous.

**Body:**

Just launched Blog Squad — AI-powered blog content with human oversight.

**The pitch:** Agency-quality posts at $300/post (vs. $800-1,500 at agencies), delivered in 24-48 hours.

**My pricing tiers:**
- Trial: $150 for 1 post (low-risk way to test quality)
- Starter: $300/post (occasional needs)
- Growth: $1,000/month for 4 posts (consistent marketing)
- Scale: $2,000/month for 8 posts (aggressive growth)

**Why I'm nervous:**

1. **Am I too cheap?** $300 might signal "low quality" to some buyers. But I also want to be accessible to startups.

2. **Trial pricing.** $150 is basically at-cost for me. But I need case studies and testimonials.

3. **Monthly vs. per-post.** Offering both because I don't know which resonates better. Probably should have picked one?

4. **AI skepticism.** Some people hear "AI" and assume garbage quality. But others see it as a feature (faster, more consistent).

Would love thoughts from anyone who's launched a productized service. How do you balance accessible pricing with perceived quality?

## 📧 Cold Outreach Email Template (Marketing Agencies)

### Subject Lines (test these)
- "Quick question about your content capacity"
- "Overflow content partner?"
- "White-label content for [Agency Name]?"

### Email Body

Subject: Quick question about your content capacity

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short — I know agency life.

I run Blog Squad, a content production service. We handle research, SEO optimization, and writing for blog posts at $300/post with 24-48 hour turnaround.

**Why I'm reaching out:** A few agencies have started using us as overflow capacity when they're stretched thin or need to deliver more content without hiring.

How it works:
- You send us the brief (or we can develop one)
- We produce SEO-optimized content with your brand voice guidelines
- You deliver to your client under your name

No contracts. No minimums. Just quality content when you need it.

If you're ever in a spot where you need extra content capacity, I'd be happy to do a trial post at cost ($150) so you can see the quality.

Either way, no pressure — just wanted to plant the seed.

[Your Name]

P.S. — Happy to share samples if helpful. Just reply and I'll send them over.

Subject: Re: Quick question about your content capacity

Hi [First Name],

Floating this back up in case it got buried.

Just wanted to see if white-label content capacity is something [Agency Name] ever needs. We've been handling overflow for a few agencies — research, SEO, writing at $300/post.

If timing's bad, totally understand. If you want to test with a $150 trial post sometime, the offer stands.

[Your Name]
